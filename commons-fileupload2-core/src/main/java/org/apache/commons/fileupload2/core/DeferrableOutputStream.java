/** An {@link OutputStream}, which keeps its data in memory, until a configured
 * threshold is reached. If that is the case, a temporary file is being created,
 * and the in-memory data is transferred to that file. All following data will
 * be written to that file, too.
 *
 * In other words: If an uploaded file is small, then it will be kept completely
 * in memory. On the other hand, if the uploaded file's size exceeds the
 * configured threshold, it it considered a large file, and the data is kept
 * in a temporary file.
 *
 * More precisely, this output stream supports three modes of operation:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code threshold=-1}: <em>Always</em> create a temporary file, even if
 *     the uploaded file is empty.</li>
 *   <li>{@code threshold=0}: Don't create empty, temporary files. (Create a
 *     temporary file, as soon as the first byte is written.)</li>
 *   <li>{@code threshold>0}: Create a temporary file, if the size exceeds the
 *     threshold, otherwise keep the file in memory.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Technically, this is similar to
 * {@link org.apache.commons.io.output.DeferredFileOutputStream}, which has
 * been used in the past, except that this implementation observes
 * a precisely specified behaviour, and semantics, that match the needs of the
 * {@link DiskFileItem}.
 *
 * Background: Over the various versions of commons-io, the
 * {@link org.apache.commons.io.output.DeferredFileOutputStream} has changed
 * semantics, and behaviour more than once.
 * (For details, see
 * <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FILEUPLOAD-295">FILEUPLOAD-295</a>)
